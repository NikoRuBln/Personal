             My name is Nikolai. I am a 23 year old Student currently living in Berin. 
            Photography was something that I did not imagine would become one of my favorite hobbies.
            It all started when I got my first analog camera from my father, a Kiev 88. Armed with this unkown thing
            and some expired rolls of 120-film I began taking some pictures. Little did I know I discovered a passion. 
            As soon as I came back to Germany I began my quest to get myself a camera to use constantly, instead of using the 
            beautiful Kiev. I got lucky and for some Euros I managed to purchase a used Minolta Dynax 5xi. Althoug my collection
            has expanded quite a bit, this is my go to camera to shoot the moments I witness.
